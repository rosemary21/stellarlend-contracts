## Key Concepts

### Reserve Factor

The **reserve factor** is a percentage (expressed in basis points) that determines what portion of interest income is allocated to protocol reserves versus distributed to lenders.

- **Range**: 0 - 5000 basis points (0% - 50%)
- **Default**: 1000 basis points (10%)
- **Configurable**: Per asset, by admin only

**Example**: With a 10% reserve factor (1000 bps):
- Borrower pays 1000 units of interest
- 100 units (10%) go to protocol reserves
- 900 units (90%) go to lenders

### Reserve Accrual

Reserves accrue automatically when interest is paid during debt repayment. The accrual process:

1. Interest is calculated based on borrowed amount and time elapsed
2. Reserve portion is calculated: `reserve = interest × reserve_factor / 10000`
3. Reserve balance is incremented
4. Lender portion is calculated: `lender_amount = interest - reserve`

### Treasury Withdrawals

The protocol admin can withdraw accrued reserves to a designated treasury address. Key properties:

- **Admin-only**: Only the protocol admin can initiate withdrawals
- **Bounded**: Withdrawals cannot exceed accrued reserve balance
- **Safe**: User funds (collateral, principal) are never accessible
- **Transparent**: All withdrawals emit events for auditability

---

## Architecture

### Storage Layout

```rust
// Reserve balance per asset
ReserveBalance(Option<Address>) -> i128

// Reserve factor per asset (basis points)
ReserveFactor(Option<Address>) -> i128

// Treasury destination address
TreasuryAddress -> Address
```

### Integration Points

The reserve module integrates with:

1. **Repay Module**: Called during interest accrual to split interest
2. **Admin Module**: Uses admin authorization for privileged operations
3. **Event System**: Emits events for all state changes
4. **Token Contracts**: (Future) Transfers reserves to treasury

**Usage**:
```rust
// Initialize with 10% reserve factor
initialize_reserve_config(&env, Some(asset_addr), 1000)?;

// Initialize native asset with 15% reserve factor
initialize_reserve_config(&env, None, 1500)?;
```

---

### Configuration Management

#### `set_reserve_factor`

Update the reserve factor for an asset (admin only).

```rust
pub fn set_reserve_factor(

## Security Model

### Authorization

| Function | Authorization | Validation |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| `initialize_reserve_config` | None (internal) | Factor bounds |
| `set_reserve_factor` | Admin only | Factor bounds |
| `accrue_reserve` | None (internal) | Overflow checks |
| `set_treasury_address` | Admin only | Address validation |
| `withdraw_reserve_to_treasury` | Admin only | Balance bounds |
| `get_*` functions | Public | None |

### Invariants

1. **Reserve Factor Bounds**: `0 ≤ reserve_factor ≤ 5000` (0% - 50%)
2. **Balance Integrity**: Reserve balance ≥ 0 at all times
3. **Withdrawal Bounds**: Withdrawal amount ≤ reserve balance
4. **User Fund Protection**: User funds never accessible via treasury operations
5. **Arithmetic Safety**: All operations use checked arithmetic
6. **Admin Control**: Only admin can modify configuration or withdraw funds

### Attack Vectors and Mitigations

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Unauthorized withdrawal | Admin-only authorization with `require_auth()` |
| Excessive reserve factor | Capped at 50% (MAX_RESERVE_FACTOR_BPS) |
| Overflow attacks | Checked arithmetic throughout |
| Reentrancy | Checks-effects-interactions pattern |
| Treasury manipulation | Treasury cannot be contract address |
| User fund theft | Reserves only from accrued interest |

### Event Emissions

All state-changing operations emit events for transparency:

```rust
// Reserve initialization
("reserve_initialized", asset, reserve_factor)

// Factor update
("reserve_factor_updated", caller, asset, new_factor)

// Reserve accrual
("reserve_accrued", asset, amount, new_balance)

// Treasury address set
("treasury_address_set", caller, treasury)

// Reserve withdrawal
("reserve_withdrawn", caller, asset, treasury, amount, new_balance)
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Setup

```rust
use crate::reserve::*;

// 1. Initialize reserve config for USDC with 10% factor
let usdc_addr = Address::from_string("G...");
initialize_reserve_config(&env, Some(usdc_addr.clone()), 1000)?;

// 2. Set treasury address
let treasury = Address::from_string("G...");
set_treasury_address(&env, admin.clone(), treasury)?;

// 3. Reserves accrue automatically during repayment
// (called internally by repay module)
let interest = 10_000_000; // 10 XLM worth of interest
let (reserve, lender) = accrue_reserve(&env, Some(usdc_addr), interest)?;
// reserve = 1_000_000 (10%)
// lender = 9_000_000 (90%)
```

### Example 2: Treasury Withdrawal

```rust
// Check current reserve balance
let balance = get_reserve_balance(&env, Some(usdc_addr.clone()));
println!("Reserve balance: {}", balance);

// Withdraw 50% of reserves to treasury
let withdraw_amount = balance / 2;
let withdrawn = withdraw_reserve_to_treasury(
    &env,
    admin,
    Some(usdc_addr.clone()),
    withdraw_amount
)?;

println!("Withdrawn: {}", withdrawn);

// Check new balance
let new_balance = get_reserve_balance(&env, Some(usdc_addr));
println!("Remaining: {}", new_balance);
```

### Example 3: Multi-Asset Reserves

```rust
// Setup reserves for multiple assets
let assets = vec![
    (Some(usdc_addr), 1000),  // 10% for USDC
    (Some(btc_addr), 1500),   // 15% for BTC
    (None, 2000),             // 20% for native XLM
];

for (asset, factor) in assets {
    initialize_reserve_config(&env, asset.clone(), factor)?;
}

// Each asset accrues independently
accrue_reserve(&env, Some(usdc_addr), 10000)?;
accrue_reserve(&env, Some(btc_addr), 5000)?;
accrue_reserve(&env, None, 8000)?;

// Get stats for all assets
for asset in [Some(usdc_addr), Some(btc_addr), None] {
    let (balance, factor, _) = get_reserve_stats(&env, asset.clone());
    println!("Asset: {:?}, Balance: {}, Factor: {}bps", 
             asset, balance, factor);
}
```

### Example 4: Dynamic Reserve Factor Adjustment

```rust
// Start with conservative 10% factor
initialize_reserve_config(&env, Some(asset), 1000)?;

// After protocol matures, increase to 15%
set_reserve_factor(&env, admin.clone(), Some(asset.clone()), 1500)?;

// During high utilization, temporarily increase to 20%
set_reserve_factor(&env, admin.clone(), Some(asset.clone()), 2000)?;

// Return to normal after utilization normalizes
set_reserve_factor(&env, admin, Some(asset), 1500)?;
```

## Integration Guide

### Integration with Repay Module

The reserve module should be called during the repayment process:

```rust
// In repay.rs
use crate::reserve::accrue_reserve;

pub fn repay_debt(
    env: &Env,
    user: Address,
    asset: Option<Address>,
    amount: i128,
) -> Result<(i128, i128, i128), RepayError> {
    // ... existing repayment logic ...
    
    // Calculate interest
    let interest = calculate_interest(env, &position)?;
    
    // Accrue reserves from interest
    let (reserve_amount, lender_amount) = accrue_reserve(
        env,
        asset.clone(),
        interest
    ).map_err(|_| RepayError::Overflow)?;
    
    // Distribute lender_amount to lenders
    // Update position with reserve_amount deducted
    
    // ... rest of repayment logic ...
}
```

### Integration with Admin Module

Reserve operations use the existing admin authorization:

```rust
// Reserve module uses admin check
fn require_admin(env: &Env, caller: &Address) -> Result<(), ReserveError> {
    let admin = env.storage()
        .persistent()
        .get::<DepositDataKey, Address>(&DepositDataKey::Admin)
        .ok_or(ReserveError::Unauthorized)?;
    
    if caller != &admin {
        return Err(ReserveError::Unauthorized);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Contract Initialization

Add reserve initialization to contract setup:

```rust
// In lib.rs initialize function
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // ... existing initialization ...
    
    // Initialize reserves for native asset
    reserve::initialize_reserve_config(
        &env,
        None,
        reserve::DEFAULT_RESERVE_FACTOR_BPS
    )?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

1. ✅ Non-admin cannot set reserve factor
2. ✅ Non-admin cannot withdraw reserves
3. ✅ Reserve factor cannot exceed 50%
4. ✅ Withdrawal cannot exceed reserve balance
5. ✅ Treasury cannot be contract address
6. ✅ Arithmetic overflow is prevented
7. ✅ User funds are never accessible

---

## Best Practices

### For Protocol Administrators

1. **Set Conservative Reserve Factors**: Start with 10-15% and adjust based on protocol needs
2. **Regular Withdrawals**: Withdraw reserves periodically to treasury for protocol development
3. **Monitor Reserve Balances**: Track reserve accrual to ensure healthy protocol revenue
4. **Secure Treasury Address**: Use multisig or secure wallet for treasury
5. **Document Changes**: Log all reserve factor changes with rationale

### For Integrators

1. **Call During Repayment**: Integrate `accrue_reserve` in repayment flow
2. **Handle Errors**: Properly handle reserve errors in repayment logic
3. **Emit Events**: Ensure reserve events are emitted for transparency
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test reserve accrual with various interest amounts
5. **Monitor Gas**: Reserve operations add minimal gas overhead

### For Auditors

1. **Verify Authorization**: Confirm admin-only functions are protected
2. **Check Arithmetic**: Verify all calculations use checked operations
3. **Test Bounds**: Validate reserve factor and withdrawal bounds
4. **Review Events**: Ensure all state changes emit events
5. **Assess Integration**: Review integration with repay module

## Error Mapping: Minimum Borrow Requirements
When a borrow request fails with `BelowMinimumBorrow` (Error Code 8), the frontend should fetch the `min_borrow_amount` for that specific asset from contract storage.
Guidance: Display a message like 'The minimum borrow amount for this asset is {min_borrow_amount}. Please increase your loan size.'
