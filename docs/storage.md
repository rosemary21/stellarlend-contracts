# StellarLend Storage Layout and Migration Guide

This document describes the persistent storage structure of the StellarLend protocol on Soroban. It serves as a reference for developers, auditors, and for planning contract upgrades.

## Overview

StellarLend uses Soroban's `persistent()` storage for all long-term data. This ensures that user balances, protocol configurations, and risk parameters remain available across ledger boundaries. All keys are defined using `contracttype` enums or `Symbol` to ensure type safety and avoid collisions.

|--------------------------|------------|-------------|
| `ProtocolMetrics` | `ProtocolMetrics` | Cached protocol-wide stats snapshot. |
| `UserMetrics(Address)` | `UserMetrics` | Cached per-user stats snapshot. |
| `ActivityLog` | `Vec<ActivityEntry>` | Global activity history (max 10,000 entries). |
| `TotalUsers` | `u64` | Total number of unique users. |
| `TotalTransactions` | `u64` | Global transaction counter. |

## Type Definitions

### Core Structs

#### `AssetPosition`
```rust
pub struct AssetPosition {
    pub collateral: i128,        // Asset's native units
    pub debt_principal: i128,    // Principal borrowed
    pub accrued_interest: i128,  // Accumulated interest
    pub last_updated: u64,       // Timestamp of last update
}
```

#### `RiskConfig`
```rust
pub struct RiskConfig {
    pub min_collateral_ratio: i128,  // Basis points (11000 = 110%)
    pub liquidation_threshold: i128, // Basis points
    pub close_factor: i128,          // Basis points
    pub liquidation_incentive: i128, // Basis points
    pub pause_switches: Map<Symbol, bool>,
    pub last_update: u64,
}
```

## Upgrade and Migration Strategy

### Wasm Upgrades
Soroban supports contract upgrades via `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`. This replaces the contract code while preserving existing storage.

### Compatibility Guidelines
1.  **Append Only**: Always add new variants to the end of `contracttype` enums to preserve discriminant mapping.
2.  **Structural Stability**: Avoid deleting or reordering fields in structs. If a field is deprecated, keep it but ignore its value.
3.  **Key Consistency**: Ensure that `contracttype` definitions used for storage keys are identical across versions.

### Data Migration Patterns
If a storage layout change is unavoidable (e.g., merging two maps into one), follow this process:
1.  **Deployment**: Deploy the new contract code.
2.  **Migration Transaction**: Execute a one-time admin function that reads old data, transforms it, and writes it to new keys.
3.  **Cleanup**: Remove the old keys to reclaim rent/storage costs.
4.  **Verification**: Execute a test suite against the migrated state.

## Security Assumptions and Validation

- **No Overwrites**: Storage keys are designed to be unique. Map-based keys use composite structures like `UserAssetKey(Address, AssetKey)` to prevent users from affecting each other's data.
- **Persistent Only**: All critical protocol state is stored in `persistent()` storage to prevent expiration (subject to rent payments).
- **Admin Isolation**: Admin addresses are stored in module-specific keys, allowing for granular permission management or a unified global admin.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All `contracttype` enums have unique variants.
- [ ] No `temporary()` or `instance()` storage is used for critical state.
- [ ] `AssetKey` correctly handles both Native (XLM) and Token assets.
- [ ] Key collisions between modules are avoided by using unique Enum types for keys.

## Migration Checklist — User Position Preservation

When introducing a new storage field or key (a "layout addition"), follow this
checklist to guarantee user positions (collateral, debt, rates, timestamps)
survive the upgrade unchanged. The safety tests in
`stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/upgrade_migration_safety_test.rs` enforce
the same invariants programmatically.

### Pre-upgrade

- [ ] **Snapshot rich fixture**: confirm seed data covers multiple users and
  multiple assets, with collateral, debt, rate, and timestamp fields populated.
- [ ] **Backup**: call `data_backup` and store the snapshot name. The
  `test_view_consistency_after_upgrade` test models this flow.
- [ ] **Schema version recorded**: capture `data_schema_version()` for use as
  the strict-greater-than check in the new bump.

### During the upgrade

- [ ] **Append-only**: new storage keys MUST live under fresh, non-overlapping
  namespaces. Never reuse a legacy key for a different value type. The
  `test_new_storage_fields_coexist_with_preserved_positions` test asserts the
  new keys never alias the old ones.
- [ ] **No in-place rewrites of legacy entries**: the migration may *read*
  legacy entries to derive new ones, but must never overwrite them with a
  different encoding during the same migration.
- [ ] **Bump schema version**: call `data_migrate_bump_version` with the new
  version and a memo describing the layout addition.

### Post-upgrade verification

- [ ] **Per-entry round-trip**: every legacy `(key, value)` pair must read back
  identically. `test_positions_preserved_across_upgrade_layout_addition` and
  `test_position_decoding_after_upgrade_round_trip` pin this at both the
  byte-level and the decoded-field level.
- [ ] **Aggregate count**: `data_entry_count()` for legacy keys must remain
  unchanged; the count for new keys must equal exactly what the migration
  wrote.
- [ ] **Sequential safety**: if multiple migrations are chained, each step
  must independently preserve all preceding entries. See
  `test_positions_preserved_across_sequential_layout_additions`.
- [ ] **Rollback semantics documented**: storage writes are not transactional
  with upgrade execution. Document any keys the migration wrote so operators
  understand they will persist even if the upgrade is rolled back. See
  `test_migration_preserves_positions_under_rollback`.

### Security notes

- A migration that silently mutates or drops user positions can socialise
  losses across the borrower set. Treat any test failure in
  `upgrade_migration_safety_test.rs` as a release-blocker.
- New storage namespaces must not collide with legacy namespaces by symbol or
  by enum discriminant. Add a regression test alongside any new storage key.
