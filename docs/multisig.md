# Multisig Module

## Overview

The **multisig** module (`src/multisig.rs`) implements a proposal–approve–execute governance pattern for critical StellarLend protocol parameters. It is a thin, focused layer on top of `governance.rs` that adds admin-set management (`ms_set_admins`) and a clean public API for the multisig flow.

---

## Flow

```
ms_set_admins([A1, A2, A3], threshold=2)
          │
A1 calls ms_propose_set_min_cr(new_ratio=20000)
          │  ← A1 auto-approves
          │
A2 calls ms_approve(proposal_id)
          │  ← threshold (2) met
          │
[wait for execution timelock — default 2 days]
          │
A3 calls ms_execute(proposal_id)
          │
Protocol parameter updated; proposal marked Executed
```

## Storage Layout

Shares all storage with `governance.rs` via `GovernanceDataKey`:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `GovernanceDataKey::MultisigAdmins` | `Vec<Address>` | Current admin set |
| `GovernanceDataKey::MultisigThreshold` | `u32` | Approval quorum |
| `GovernanceDataKey::ProposalCounter` | `u64` | Monotonic proposal ID counter |
| `GovernanceDataKey::Proposal(id)` | `Proposal` | Proposal data |
| `GovernanceDataKey::ProposalApprovals(id)` | `Vec<Address>` | Per-proposal approvals |

---

## Functions

### `ms_set_admins(env, caller, admins, threshold)`

> **Auth:** Existing admin (or any caller at first bootstrap)

Replaces the multisig admin set and threshold atomically.

| Param | Type | Constraint |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `admins` | `Vec<Address>` | Non-empty, no duplicates |
| `threshold` | `u32` | `1 ≤ threshold ≤ len(admins)` |

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidMultisigConfig`

---

### `ms_propose_set_min_cr(env, proposer, new_ratio)`

> **Auth:** Registered multisig admin

Creates a `MinCollateralRatio` proposal. The proposer automatically approves.

| Param | Type | Constraint |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `new_ratio` | `i128` | > 10,000 bps (> 100%) |

**Returns:** `u64` proposal ID

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidProposal`

**Events:** `proposal_created(proposal_id, proposer)` + `proposal_approved(proposal_id, proposer)`

---

### `ms_approve(env, approver, proposal_id)`

> **Auth:** Registered multisig admin

Adds one approval to a proposal. Duplicate approvals rejected.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `ProposalNotFound`, `AlreadyVoted`

**Events:** `proposal_approved(proposal_id, approver)`

---

### `ms_execute(env, executor, proposal_id)`

> **Auth:** Registered multisig admin

Executes the proposal after the approval threshold is met **and** the execution timelock has elapsed.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InsufficientApprovals`, `ProposalNotReady`, `ProposalAlreadyExecuted`

**Events:** `proposal_executed(proposal_id, executor)`

---

## View Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `get_ms_admins(env)` | `Option<Vec<Address>>` | Current admin list |
| `get_ms_threshold(env)` | `u32` | Approval threshold (default `1`) |
| `get_ms_proposal(env, id)` | `Option<Proposal>` | Proposal by ID |
| `get_ms_approvals(env, id)` | `Option<Vec<Address>>` | Approvals for a proposal |

---

## Security Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Single admin key compromise | t-of-n threshold before any parameter changes |
| Replay of executed proposals | `ProposalStatus::Executed` checked; `ProposalAlreadyExecuted` returned on second attempt |
| Old proposal ID reuse | Monotonic counter in `governance.rs` — IDs never decrease |
| Front-running a proposal | Proposer auto-approves in the same call, so no window between creation and first approval |
| Rushed execution | Execution timelock (default 2 days) gives time to detect malicious proposals |

---

## Extending with New Actions

To add a new governable parameter (e.g. `SetReserveFactor`):

1. Add a variant to `ProposalType` in `governance.rs`:
   ```rust
   SetReserveFactor(i128),
   ```
2. Add a new propose function in `multisig.rs`:
   ```rust
   pub fn ms_propose_set_reserve_factor(env: &Env, proposer: Address, factor: i128)
       -> Result<u64, GovernanceError> { ... }
   ```
3. Add execution logic inside `execute_proposal` in `governance.rs`:
   ```rust
   ProposalType::SetReserveFactor(f) => { /* persist */ }
   ```
4. Add tests in `multisig_test.rs`.
5. Expose the entrypoint in `lib.rs`.

---

## Integration — `lib.rs` changes needed

Add to `lib.rs`:

```rust
pub mod multisig;

use multisig::{ms_set_admins, ms_propose_set_min_cr, ms_approve, ms_execute};
```

Then expose on `HelloContract`:

```rust
pub fn ms_set_admins(env: Env, caller: Address, admins: Vec<Address>, threshold: u32)
    -> Result<(), GovernanceError> { multisig::ms_set_admins(&env, caller, admins, threshold) }

pub fn ms_propose_set_min_cr(env: Env, proposer: Address, new_ratio: i128)
    -> Result<u64, GovernanceError> { multisig::ms_propose_set_min_cr(&env, proposer, new_ratio) }

pub fn ms_approve(env: Env, approver: Address, proposal_id: u64)
    -> Result<(), GovernanceError> { multisig::ms_approve(&env, approver, proposal_id) }

pub fn ms_execute(env: Env, executor: Address, proposal_id: u64)
    -> Result<(), GovernanceError> { multisig::ms_execute(&env, executor, proposal_id) }
```

---

## Events Reference

All events emitted via helpers in `governance.rs`:

| Event | Topics | Payload |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `proposal_created` | `(proposal_id, proposer)` | — |
| `proposal_approved` | `(proposal_id, approver)` | — |
| `proposal_executed` | `(proposal_id, executor)` | — |
| `proposal_failed` | `(proposal_id)` | — |

## Safe Threshold and Signer-Set Change Workflow

Changing the multisig threshold or signer set is a high-risk operation. An
incorrect sequence can create a window where protocol actions are executable
with weaker security than intended, or leave governance permanently deadlocked.

### Recommended Sequences

#### Raising security (adding signers or increasing threshold)

Always use `ms_set_admins` to atomically replace both the signer list and the
threshold in a single call. This eliminates any intermediate state.

```
# Safe: atomic replace — new threshold applies to the new set immediately
ms_set_admins([A1, A2, A3], threshold=2)
```

If you must use two steps, raise the threshold **before** adding the new signer:

```
# Step 1: raise threshold while signer count is still the same
ms_set_admins([A1, A2], threshold=2)   # was threshold=1

# Step 2: add A3 — threshold is already at the desired level
ms_set_admins([A1, A2, A3], threshold=2)
```

#### Lowering security (removing signers or decreasing threshold)

Lowering the threshold or removing a signer should be done with extra caution.
Prefer the atomic form:

```
# Safe: atomic replace
ms_set_admins([A1, A2], threshold=2)   # removes A3, keeps threshold
```

If you must lower the threshold separately, do it **after** removing the signer:

```
# Step 1: remove A3 first (threshold stays at 2-of-2, still valid)
ms_set_admins([A1, A2], threshold=2)

# Step 2: lower threshold only if intentional
set_ms_threshold(threshold=1)
```

Never lower the threshold before removing a signer — this creates a window
where fewer approvals than intended can execute proposals.

#### Replacing the entire signer set

Use a single `ms_set_admins` call. The old set is replaced atomically; there
is no window where the old threshold applies to the new set or vice versa.

```
ms_set_admins([NewA1, NewA2, NewA3], threshold=2)
```

## Security Notes: Preventing Downgrade Attacks

### Threshold is captured at proposal creation time

When a proposal is created via `ms_propose_set_min_cr` (or any propose
function), the **current multisig threshold is stored on the proposal** in the
`multisig_threshold` field. This stored value is the binding quorum for that
proposal — it cannot be retroactively changed.

This prevents the following attack:

1. Attacker creates a proposal when threshold = 3 (needs 3 approvals).
2. Attacker lowers threshold to 1.
3. Attacker tries to execute with only 1 approval.

Step 3 fails because `ms_execute` checks `proposal.multisig_threshold` (= 3),
not the current global threshold (= 1).

### Constraints enforced on every threshold/signer change

| Constraint | Enforced by | Error |
|---|---|---|
| Threshold ≥ 1 | `ms_set_admins`, `set_ms_threshold` | `InvalidMultisigConfig` / `InvalidThreshold` |
| Threshold ≤ signer count | `ms_set_admins`, `set_ms_threshold` | `InvalidMultisigConfig` / `InvalidThreshold` |
| No duplicate signers | `ms_set_admins` | `InvalidMultisigConfig` |
| Non-empty signer set | `ms_set_admins` | `InvalidMultisigConfig` |
| Caller must be existing admin | `ms_set_admins` (post-bootstrap), `set_ms_threshold` | `Unauthorized` |

### Execution timelock

`ms_execute` enforces a 24-hour delay from proposal creation before any
proposal can be executed, regardless of how many approvals it has. This gives
the remaining admins time to detect and respond to a malicious proposal before
it takes effect.

### Expiry window

Proposals expire 14 days after creation if not executed. An expired proposal
cannot be executed; a new proposal must be created.

### Bootstrap vs. post-bootstrap

`ms_set_admins` accepts any caller during the initial bootstrap (when no
multisig config exists yet). After bootstrap, only an existing admin can call
it. Ensure the bootstrap call is made in the same transaction as contract
initialization to avoid a front-running window.

---

## Failure Recovery

### Scenario: threshold accidentally set too high (governance deadlocked)

If the threshold is set higher than the number of available signers (e.g. a
key is lost), governance is deadlocked. Recovery options:

1. **Social recovery** — if guardians are configured, use `start_recovery` /
   `approve_recovery` / `execute_recovery` to rotate the admin key, then
   reconfigure the multisig.
2. **Key recovery** — recover the lost signing key from secure backup.

Prevention: always keep at least one more signer than the threshold (n-of-m
where m > n) so a single key loss does not deadlock governance.

### Scenario: malicious proposal approved before detection

If a malicious proposal reaches the approval threshold:

1. The 24-hour execution timelock gives a response window.
2. Any existing admin can call `cancel_proposal` before execution.
3. After cancellation, rotate the compromised key via `ms_set_admins`.

### Scenario: signer key compromised

1. Immediately call `ms_set_admins` with the compromised key removed and a
   replacement key added, keeping the threshold the same or higher.
2. Review all pending proposals for approvals from the compromised key.
3. Cancel any proposals that were approved by the compromised key if their
   legitimacy is in doubt.
