# StellarLend Lending Contract

A secure, efficient lending protocol built on Soroban that allows users to borrow assets against collateral with built-in risk management, flash loans, and governance.

## Features

- **Collateralized Borrowing**: Borrow assets by providing collateral with configurable liquidation thresholds.
- **Interest Accrual**: Automatic interest calculation based on protocol parameters.
- **Risk Management**: Protocol-level debt ceilings, deposit caps, and liquidation incentives.
- **Flash Loans**: Zero-collateral, single-transaction loans with configurable fees.
- **Granular Pausing**: Ability to pause specific operations (Deposit, Borrow, Repay, Withdraw, Liquidation) or the entire protocol.
- **Emergency Lifecycle**: `Normal -> Shutdown -> Recovery -> Normal` flow for handling catastrophic events.
- **Multi-sig Governance**: Secure upgrade mechanism requiring multiple approvals.
- **Persistent Data Store**: Versatile storage system with backup/restore and migration capabilities.
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Protection against overflow/underflow using checked arithmetic.

## Building

## Contract Interface

### User Operations
- `deposit(env, user, asset, amount)` - Deposit assets into the protocol.
- `borrow(env, user, asset, amount, collateral_asset, collateral_amount)` - Borrow assets against deposited collateral.
- `repay(env, user, asset, amount)` - Repay borrowed assets including accrued interest.
- `withdraw(env, user, asset, amount)` - Withdraw collateral from the protocol.
- `liquidate(env, liquidator, borrower, debt_asset, collateral_asset, amount)` - Liquidate under-collateralized positions.
- `flash_loan(env, receiver, asset, amount, params)` - Execute a flash loan.
- `deposit_collateral(env, user, asset, amount)` - Add collateral to an existing borrow position.

### View Functions
- `get_user_position(env, user)` - Returns full position summary (balances, values, health factor).
- `get_health_factor(env, user)` - Returns current health factor (scaled 10000 = 1.0).
- `get_collateral_value(env, user)` - Returns total collateral value in common units (e.g., USD).
- `get_debt_value(env, user)` - Returns total debt value in common units.
- `get_max_liquidatable_amount(env, user)` - Returns maximum debt that can be liquidated in one call.
- `get_liquidation_incentive_amount(env, repay_amount)` - Returns bonus collateral for liquidators.
- `get_emergency_state(env)` - Returns current lifecycle state (`Normal`, `Shutdown`, `Recovery`).
- `get_performance_stats(env)` - Returns gas/performance stats for the transaction.

### Admin & Risk Control
- `initialize(env, admin, debt_ceiling, min_borrow_amount)` - Initial protocol setup.
- `set_oracle(env, admin, oracle)` - Configure price feed source.
- `set_pause(env, admin, pause_type, paused)` - Toggles granular or global pause state.
- `set_guardian(env, admin, guardian)` - Configure emergency guardian authorized for shutdown.
- `set_liquidation_threshold_bps(env, admin, bps)` - Set threshold for liquidations (e.g., 80%).
- `set_close_factor_bps(env, admin, bps)` - Set max fraction liquidatable per call.
- `emergency_shutdown(env, caller)` - Trigger hard protocol stop (Admin or Guardian).
- `start_recovery(env, admin)` - Transition from Shutdown to Recovery mode.
- `complete_recovery(env, admin)` - Return protocol to Normal operation from Recovery.

### Governance (Upgrades)
- `upgrade_init(env, admin, wasm_hash, threshold)` - Initialize upgrade manager.
- `upgrade_propose(env, caller, wasm_hash, version)` - Propose a new contract version.
- `upgrade_approve(env, caller, proposal_id)` - Approve a pending upgrade proposal.
- `upgrade_execute(env, caller, proposal_id)` - Apply the approved upgrade.

### Data Store Management
- `data_store_init(env, admin)` - Initialize the persistent storage manager.
- `data_save(env, caller, key, value)` - Persist arbitrary data (authorized writers only).
- `data_load(env, key)` - Retrieve data by key.
- `data_backup(env, caller, name)` - Create a snapshot of current storage.
- `data_restore(env, caller, name)` - Restore storage from a named snapshot.

## View Serialization Stability

The contract treats the current struct-returning getter responses as view schema `v1`.

Covered getters:

- `get_user_debt() -> DebtPosition`
- `get_user_collateral() -> BorrowCollateral`
- `get_user_collateral_deposit() -> DepositCollateral`
- `get_user_position() -> UserPositionSummary`

Wire-format guarantee:

- Soroban `#[contracttype]` structs encode as XDR maps keyed by field name.
- The generated conversion code sorts those keys lexicographically, so the on-wire key order is deterministic.
- Snapshot-style tests lock the current XDR encoding for the getter structs above.

Stable decoding guidance:

- Decode these responses by field name, not by source declaration order.
- Treat the current field set and field names as schema `v1`.
- Do not assume a new field can be added safely to an existing getter response. Even additive changes can break strict decoders and hash-based snapshots.

Versioning strategy:

- Existing getter response structs are preserved in place for schema `v1`.
- Any additive or breaking change to one of the getter structs must ship as a new versioned getter/type, for example `get_user_position_v2()`, instead of mutating the current response shape.
- A runtime `schema` field is intentionally not added to the existing structs because that would itself be a breaking ABI change for the current getter surface.

### Flash Loan Flow
```mermaid

    participant C as Lending Contract
    participant R as Receiver Contract
    C->>R: 1. Send Loaned Amount
    Note right of R: 2. Execute Flash Loan Logic
    R->>C: 3. Repay Amount + Fee
    C->>C: 4. Verify Repayment
```

## Security & Trust Boundaries

### Authorization & Access Control
- **Multisig Admin**: Critical operations (risk parameters, pauses, upgrades) require Admin authorization, ideally a multisig or DAO.
- **Guardian**: A secondary role authorized *only* to trigger `emergency_shutdown`.
- **User Verification**: All user actions (`borrow`, `repay`, etc.) strictly enforce `require_auth()` for the actor.

### Execution Safety
- **Reentrancy**: Flash loans utilize a callback pattern; the protocol state is validated before and after the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Arithmetic Integrity**: Every calculation uses checked methods to prevent overflows/underflows. Boundary checks are enforced on all risk parameters.
- **Isolation**: User positions and protocol settings are stored in distinct namespaces to prevent data cross-contamination.
