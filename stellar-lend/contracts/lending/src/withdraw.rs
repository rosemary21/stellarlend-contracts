//! # Withdraw collateral
//!
//! Withdrawals reduce a user’s posted collateral while preserving **minimum collateral ratio**
//! against outstanding debt (same 150% rule as [`crate::borrow::validate_collateral_ratio`]).
//!
//! ## Pause & emergency alignment
//!
//! Withdraw respects:
//! - Legacy `WithdrawDataKey::Paused` (storage compatibility),
//! - Granular [`crate::pause::PauseType::Withdraw`] and global [`crate::pause::PauseType::All`]
//!   via [`crate::pause::is_paused`],
//! - Emergency lifecycle: **shutdown** blocks unwind; **recovery** allows `withdraw` and `repay`
//!   so users can exit (see [`crate::pause::blocks_high_risk_ops`], [`crate::pause::is_recovery`]).
//!
//! This matches the public `LendingContract::withdraw` policy: callers get a single consistent
//! check path through [`withdraw`] without duplicating pause logic in the facade.
//!
//! ## Security
//! - **Authorization**: [`withdraw`] requires `user.require_auth()`.
//! - **State**: Collateral and totals are updated before publishing events (no external token hook
//!   in this simplified flow; CEI still applies to storage writes).
//! - **Arithmetic**: Uses `checked_*` and shared borrow validation to avoid overflow and drift.
